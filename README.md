# Pirate's Crossing - BetaJam 2 Entry

Welcome to the repository for Pirate's Crossing, my entry for BetaJam 2 GameJam. 
The theme for the GameJam was "Pirate".

## Description
Pirate's Crossing is a frogger-like game where you play as a pirate on a mission to find treasure hidden on the shores of a river. You must navigate through various obstacles to collect as much treasure as possible without dying. 

## "Backstory"
Yngvar Rednose has lost his crew, as they sail away to find a better captain. Yngvar is clever though! He saw through the mutinous dogs and foresaw the ploy to take his ship. Yngvar has hidden treasures along the river to help him establish his power again! Sadly minotaurs are rampaging the riverbed, and they aren't happy. Help Yngvar navigate the minotaur rampage and cross the river to get to his booty.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply download it from [this itch.io page][https://nixxenftw.itch.io/pirates-crossing] and run the game file on your local machine. Use the arrow keys to move your character. 

## Credits
This game was developed by Nixxen during BetaLan 27, for the event BetaJam 2.
Various art assets from ItchIO were used. Details can be given upon request.

## Issues
The game is not intended to be played as a completed game. It was hammered together in a caffeine-fueled night of passion, and stands on its own, warts and all.
The issues section is only used as a wishlist during development.
That said, if you encounter any issues while playing the game, please submit a bug report in the issues section of this repository, just don't expect them to ever be fixed.

Thank you for checking out Pirate's Crossing! I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
